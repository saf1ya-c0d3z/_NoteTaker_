  ##Description
  User Story

```md
This is a note taker/saver/deleter designed to help busy workers or students to keep track of their obligations. As busy students we need help so we make sure we do not forget to do and assigment, attend a tutor session, or important details from class we need to remember to understand the topics we learn and complete our assignments. With the note taker app the user will be able to quickly take and save notes. Once the user no longer needs the note, they will be able to delete it so they can have a organized saved note column. This is especially helpful because this helps students minds remain clutter free so they can effectively absorb the new material they learn in class.
